# My Knowledge Store
*Sawit Trisirisatayawong (tansawit)*

## Introduction

I have come to realize that there is two feelings that I hate when it come to learning and information: forgetting something you definitely knew, and not remembering valuable resources.

Thus, I’ve been trying to restructure and reorganize the way I interact and consume information. This will not only ensure that I can find the things I need most the time, but also forces me to express whatever I’m jotting down in my on words, hopefully assisting with retention.

To that end, this site aims to serve as a place to store all the things I’ve learned, liked, or came across for easy access and as a potential resource for anyone else to use.

## About Me

A recent University of Michigan graduate and now based in Bangkok, I develop chatbots for local businesses to integrate into social media channels to help them acquire customers, engage and retain those customers, and better understand their customer base. 

I also occasionally consult to small and early/seed-stage startups, helping them refine their ideas and product implementations, develop their business models, and improve their understanding of their markets.

In my spare time I like to analyse and visualize interesting datasets, watch movies, TV shows, and anime, read books, listen to music and podcasts, and take photos [(Instagram)][1]. 

More info about me can be found on my [main website][2]
