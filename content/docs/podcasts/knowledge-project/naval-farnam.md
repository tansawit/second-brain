# Naval Farnam: The Angel Philosopher

## Review

Amazing conversation on habits and breaking them, reading, and reconfiguring your mind. Discussions on the freedom, trust, and education. Presents idea of your body and mind as layers of mechanisms. Defining personal happiness, priorities, radical honesty, and values.
## Core Ideas

### Values

- Defining values as what you won't compromise on
- Working with your values is long-term selfish, although short-term
it absolutely involves sacrifices.
- If being ethical were profitable, everybody would do it

### The Mind

> The mind should be the tool, the waiter, not the commander.

- Suppressing your monkey mind doesn't work. It's essentially playing mind games with yourself.
- Run brain in 'debugging mode'. Have self-awareness.

#### Limiting Yourself

> Creating identities and labels locks you and keeps you from seeing the truth.

- Saying 'never' and 'always' are ways of limiting yourself. Makes you feel less free and less happy
- 'I don't have time' is another way of saying 'it's not a priority'

### Freedom and Happiness
>I’m addicted to the desiring. I’m addicted to the idea that this external thing is going to bring me some kind of happiness and joy and this is completely delusional.

- Defining happiness as the absence of desire for external things
- A lot of our unhappiness comes from comparing things
- The idea of going from seeking "freedom to" to "freedom from"
- Money is just a piece of paper. It is an anchor. Instead create something brand new that the world can get value out if it and uses and is congruent to your morals

### Truth
> To see the truth, you have to get your ego out of the way because your ego doesn’t want to face the truth.

- A moment of suffering is that it's that moment when you see things exactly the way they are.
- The good news is that when you’re suffering, when you’re in pain, that’s a
moment of truth.
- The more of a desire that I have that it work out a certain way, the less likely I
am to see the truth.

### Trust

- People who have high integrity are very easy to negotiate with
- Bucket list for deciding who to trust: intelligence, energy, integrity.
- Integrity
  - Long-term: Knowing someone for a while
  - Short-term: See how they treat other people (do something that is self-dealing or relatively unethical)

### Knowledge

- Real knowledge is intrinsic, and it's built from the ground up.
- The mark of a genius is to explain complicated things in
simple ways.

### Life

> All the benefits in life comes from compound interest.

- Do things with less emotions and less anger. Do them with a long-term perspectives.
- We are programmed to play a multiplayer competitive games. But life is a single player game. External progress, validation, success doesn't matter in the end.
- You can't cherry-pick aspects of other people's lives. You have to be that person. With all their reactions, happiness level, family, outlook, desires.
- Only the individual transcend. Nobody reaches enlightenment or internal happiness
or does serious internal work in group settings
- Giving up the macro, embracing the micro.
- There is nothing but this moment.
- All you need to do is what you want to do.
- Your goal in life is to find the people who need you the most, the business that needs you the most. There is something out there just for you.
- If you are willing to make the short-term sacrifice, you’ll have the long-term benefit.
- Great people have great outcomes. You just have to be patient

### Ideas and Business

> Vision without execution is a hallucination. Execution alone isn’t enough.

- There are no new ideas. All the ideas have been thought of.
It’s about the combination of the idea plus the execution plus the passion.
- The best founders have a deep understanding of the space they’re going into, enough to be contrarian.
  - Even decisions that maybe they shouldn’t care that much about early on,
they fix it because they are not building a house, they’re putting bricks in the
foundation of the skyscraper, at least in their minds.
- What you’re looking for is looking for someone who knows the space well,
who understands how difficult it’s going to be, but doesn’t care because they
just love whatever they’re doing.

### Decision Making

> Being successful is about not making mistakes. It's not about having correct judgement. It's about avoiding incorrect judgements.

- Someone who makes decisions right 10% of the time more will be compensated 100x more.
- The brain is a memory-prediction machine. It has memory of what's worked in the past and it tries to predict the future. What you want is mental models (Evolution, Game Theory, Charlie Munger, Nassim Taleb, Benjamin Franklin)
- Fundamentally we are ignorant and very bad at predicting the future.
- Set up systems not goals.
- Make sure you're dealing with reality when making decisions by not having a strong sense of self or judgments or mind presence

### Education and Learning

> The ability and means to learn is abundant and infinite. It is the desire to learn that is incredibly scarce.

- Kids are learning machines. They just need the tools.
- We haven't kept up with what students should be learning.
- Mathematics the language of nature. Science is the study of truth. It is the one true discipline because it makes falsify-able predictions.
- Read the stuff you're reading because you enjoy it. There is no mission.

### Human Society

- There might not be a single best answer for human culture society.
- As a human race, we might need to get past the idea of us as separate organism and embrace multi-cellular organisms.
- Things like the Singularity and the afterlife are pernicious. It takes you out of the moment and give you hope for today. You stop living for today and start living for tomorrow. It keeps you from an incredible experience, seeing the beauty in everything and from being grateful in where you are.
- If you believe we’re living in a VR sim, which I know some people are espousing, or if you believe the Buddhist view of the world, with samsara and nirvana and all that, you would actually come to the same conclusions on how to live your life.

### Rational Buddhism

- 'Rational' means reconciling with science and evolution. Verifying things yourself

### Two-Factor Authentication Calendar Method

- When making a commitment to anything, just write it down and then just check back in 48-hours later and then with a clear mind. Then ask yourself: Do I commit to this?
- “If I commit to doing something, then I commit to doing it right now.” If I’m not willing to
do it right now, then don’t do it. Don’t commit to it.
- The Derek Sivers approach: If you’re not saying, “Hell yes” right now,
then you should just be saying no
