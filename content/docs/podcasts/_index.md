# Podcasts

I listen to a lot of podcasts. While I love music and listening to it, I've trying to force myself to listen to podcasts anytime when I would normally listen to music instead (i.e. travelling, commuting) unless I'm completely on a break. I find it to be a better use of the time which would otherwise goes unused.
