## 'Focusing' your life

> Specialization is for insects

All humans are broad/multivariate, capable of every experience and every thought, but we get summarized. You have one life. Just do everything.

It's painful to start over on a new thing, but that may be the best things to do.

## Knowledge

Difference between 'knowing' (memorizing) something and 'understanding' it.

Read to satisfy intellectual curiosity, for understanding, rather than to complete it.

## Pursuit of Fame

You want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous.

It doesnâ€™t take a lot of insults to cancel out a good self image.

## Social Contracts

Social contracts are very powerful. Humans have a need to be highly consistent with their past pronouncements.

## Happiness and Choices

### Defining happiness

Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.

Pick your one overwhelming desire and allow yourself to suffer over that one. Let go of all the others.

### Happiness as a Choice

Fitness and health can be a choice. Working hard can be a choice. Making money is a choice. Why can't happiness also be a choice.

The pursuit of excellence and success and happiness is not a tradeoff. You want to be happy **and** calm.

### Benefits of a Calm and Happy Mind

We live in an age of infinite leverage. Our actions can be multiplied a thousand-fold (starting a business, podcasts, writing code etc). Thus the impact of good decision-making are much higher.

A clear mind therefore leads to better judgement, better outcome. If you want to operate at peak performance, you need to learn how to tame your mind, just as how you tame your body.

## Work and Freedom

### Effort/Time vs Output

The world is not linear. People who put in the same amount (time) of work does not get the same amount of output. What you do, who you do it with, how you do it are all more important.

As an intellectual athlete, train like one; train, sprint, rest, reassess, repeat.

### Defining true freedom and wealth/riches

If someone can tell you when to be at work, what to wear, how to behave, you're not free, you're not actually rich.

### Impact of Information Technology on Working

#### Coase Theorem 

Describes whether a firm would hire an external provider or develop an in-house solution. This mostly depends on how hard it is to execute the transaction with the external entity. 

Information technology is making it easier to do these transactions externally. This leads to the atomization of the firm and the 'optimal' size of the firm shrinking. This is most obvious in Silicon Valley; startups shaving little pieces of business from companies and turning them into huge markets (e.g. Craiglist vacation rental market turning into AirBnB). High quality work will soon be available in the future. 

Information revolution, by making it easier to connect, communicate, and co-operate, is allowing us to go back to working from ourselves.

## AI, Automation, and Jobs

### Automation and Jobs

Automation has been happening since the dawn of time. Electricity put a lot of people out of work.

The question is not whether automation will eliminate jobs. It will free people up to be more creative. There is no finite number of jobs. New, better, more creative jobs are being created. 

The question ae how quickly will this transition happen, what kinds of jobs will be eliminated, and what kinds will be created.

The problem is how quickly you can re-train people. It's an education problem.

### Universal Basic Income

People who are down on their luck are not looking for handouts. It's not just about money, it's also about status, about meaning. The moment you start giving them money, you've made them a 'second-class citizen'. What they need is to be given meaning. And meaning comes through education.
