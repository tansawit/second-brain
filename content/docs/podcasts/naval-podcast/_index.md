True/Ethical Wealth Creation
- Creating abundance/wealth
- Everyone can be 'rich'
  - Everyone in the first-world is richer than anybody alive 200 years ago
- It is a merely a question of education and desire
  - You just have to want it
- If you have too many takers and not enough makers, society falls apart 
- If a society does not respect it, society will plunge into ruins and darkness

- Be consistent in creating wealth. Stacks up little bits at a time (more businesses, more investment, more opportunities etc.)
  - Compound interest

Getting wealthy you can retire, have you freedom
- You don't have to be in any place you don't want to be
- You don't have to do anything you don't want to do
- You can wake up when you want
- You can sleep when you wan
- You don' have a boss
- That's freedom.

Time
- Running out of time

## Money

- A form social credit/IOU
- How we transfer wealth
- Making money isn't about luck
- It's about becoming the kind of person that makes money
- In a 1000 alternate universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them, not the 50 that you get lucky

4 Types of Luck

- Blind luck
  - Something out of your control happen (fortune, fate)
- From persistence, hustle, motion
  - When you're doing a lot of things, luck will find you
- Becomes good at spotting luck
  - Notice when a lucky break happens when you're skilled in a field. Comes from experience and knowledge
- Build unique character/brand
  - Unique skills that makes people and things come to you
  - Starts to fade definition to destiny

You want the kind of reputation that makes people do deals through you. Your character/reputation will let you take opportunities that others may classify as luck.
Eccentricity is not necessarily a bad thing 

"Extreme people gets extreme results" Sam Altman
"You can be normal and expect abnormal results"
"Play stupid games. Win stupid prices"

## Status

- Zero sum game (i.e. politics, sports)
- Fundamentally we play them because they're a necessary evil
- In a status game, you win by putting somebody else down

## Capitalism

- Intrinsic to the human species
- Not something invented, not something discovered
- Innate in every exchange humans have (notion of exchange)

## Freedom
