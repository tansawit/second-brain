## Introduction

Here you'll find a collection of books that I've read, my review, as well as a summary of the key points I take away from it.

## Anything You Want - Derek Sivers

[(Book)](https://amzn.to/32mguHI)[(Review & Notes)]({{<relref "/docs/books/anything-you-want">}})

> Never forget why you’re really doing what you’re doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn’t that enough?

Amazing life lessons for both entrepreneurs both current and aspiring, as well as anyone else. As someone who's recently started their career and started to feel the urge to always be working at all times, this book has really helped reframe the way I approach what I do and my mindset towards working in general. Various lessons for life, mindset, and business, explained through the author's personal experiences.
