# Anything You Want - Derek Sivers

*Read: October 2019* (✭✭✭✭✩)

## Review

Really useful lessons for both entrepreneurs both current and aspiring, as well as anyone else. As someone who's recently started their career and started to feel the urge to always be working at all times, this book has really helped reframe the way I approach what I do and my mindset towards working in general.

## Summary

Various lessons for life, mindset, business, and entrepreneurship. All of this is explained through the Derek's personal anecdote of starting his previous company CD Baby. A different outlook on the mindset in which to approach starting a business, valuing whether you enjoy doing it above whether it makes a lot of money.

### Building a Business

#### Mindset

**Start now. Start small.** This way, you put 100% of your energy into actually solving problems for real people. And while you should never forget that everything you do should be for your customers, **proudly exclude people**. The world is a large place. You can leave out 99% of it and the 1% remaining is still massive. And that 1% love how much you value them.

Most importantly, when you feel overwhelmed, when you always feel like you should always be working, growing, hustling even when you're relaxing remember this: 

> Never forget why you’re really doing what you’re doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn’t that enough?

Enjoy life. It's normal for you to want to improve and grow something that you love and worked hard on. But never forget why you're actually doing it.

#### Ideas and Business Plans

**Even though ideas are important, they are worth nothing without execution.** They are just a multiplier. It is the execution of that idea that's worth millions. And don't limit yourself to only one way of doing anything. Your first idea is just one of many options. **No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans.**

When transitioning from a an idea to a business plan, keep in mind that **the best plans start simple**. And don't get too attach to any particular one. As Steve Blank said:

>No business plan survives first contact with customers

When explaining your idea to anyone, don't try to impress an invisible jury or MBA professors. **It's OK to be casual. What is important, however, is clarity**, and you should feel pain when you're being unclear.

#### Building a Product

While many people strive to get big-name brands such as Apple and Google to be their clients, there are downsides to doing so compared to focusing on smaller clients:

Building a product to attract large clients

- Custom-tailored products that fit very few people
- Potentially lose touch with what the rest of the world wants

<--->

Building a product for smaller clients

- You are completely your own boss
- Hear a lot more people's opinion

{{< /columns >}}

When improving and iterating upon a product as it grows, be aware that **“more of the same” is never the answer**. You’d have to do things in a new way to handle twice as much business. Things needs to be changed, to be improved, to be streamlined.

#### Users

Two simple lessons for this one:

- When one customer wrongs you, remember the hundred thousand who did not. **Learn to shrug of the negative experiences.**
- Care about your customers more than about yourself, and you’ll do well. Remember, you are doing it for them.

#### Funding

An idea doesn't need funding to start. Someone that says they can't do something big without funding usually is more in love with the idea of being big than doing something useful.

Having money is also not an advantage. **You don't need it to start helping people.**

#### Growing and Success

If it's not a hit, switch

> Success comes from persistently improving, not from persistently promoting what's not working.

As your business grows, try to **make yourself unnecessary to its daily running**. And to grow, focus entirely on your existing customer

#### Team

To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.

> "hire lightly and fire lightly"

When it comes to building a team, **consider hiring lightly and fire lightly**. It’s almost impossible to tell what someone’s going to be like on the job until he’s actually on the job for a few weeks.

### Work

**Delegate, but don't abdicate**. It's important to know when and how to spread out the work, but never do it to the extent that you involuntarily relinquish power and/or responsibility.


### Happiness

Make sure you know what makes you happy, and don’t forget it.

> The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy


### Success

**When you're onto something great, it won't feel like a revolution. It'll feel like uncommon sense**.

> If you think revolution needs to feel like a war, you'll overlook the importance of simply serving people better.

Finally, note that 'revolution' is a term that people use only when you're successful. Before that, you're just a quirky person who does things differently.


### Life

Not everything in life comes instantly or suddenly. If you think your life's purpose needs to hit you like a lightning bolt, you'll overlook the little day-to-day things that fascinate you.

> Never say 'yes'. Say only either 'no' or 'hell yeah!' 

When you say "no" to most things, you leave room for things that makes you say, "Hell yeah!". We're all busy. We've all taken on too much. Saying yes less is the way out.
