# Man's Search for Meaning - Victor Frankl

## On Survival

"He who has the Why to live for can bear almost any how"

"Man's inner strength may raise him above his outward fate"

In the context of concentration camps prisoners: "they died less from lack of food or medicine than from lack of hope, lack of something to look for"

One can survive almost anything, regardless of the circumstances, as long as one have a reason to live. That Why will enable them to bear any How they face.

## On Life

"Life is meaningful and that we must learn to see life as meaningful despite our circumstances"

"Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure or for power, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life.

Sources for meaning 
- Work (doing something significant)
- Love (caring for another person)
- Courage (during difficult times)

"Suffering in and of itself is meaningless: we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it."

"You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will fell and do about what happens to you."

"We are never left with nothing as long as we retain the freedom to choose how we will respond."

Once one given up faith in his strength to carry on, that faith rarely ever return.

## On the author's experience

As a methodical presentation of the subject is difficult, as psychology requires a certain degree of detachment. Therefore does a man who himself was a prisoner possess the necessary detachment? Avoid bias.

Three phases of a prisoner's experience:

Post admission

Shock

the dread

the sense of "delusion of reprieve" (psychiatry): a condemned man gets the illusion that he might be reprieved at the last minute

the thought of those being the executioner knowing full well that one day they will become the executed

the naivite and cluelessness in not knowing your fate

losing your material possession as a concrete shift for detaching from your previous life

grim turned into humor

curiosity: curiosity as to whether O should come out of it alive or with injuries

"We had nothing to lose except your so ridiculously naked lives"

extreme conditions leading to pushing the human body beyond what we think we can do

fear of death, gas chanbers, lost their horrors after the first few days - only because they spare them the act of committing suicide

Entrenched in camp routine

relative apathy

emotional death

regression to a more primitive and mental state, focused on wishes and desires

to be able to pinpoint one's own as well as other's demise so accurately

"love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire" => "the salvation of man is through love and in love"

love the giver of power to continue, as the only thing left to drive them forward. the last glimmer of hope and motivation to continue living

the longing for ones love one as  driving force 

amusing dreams of the future, ridiculing the sad state that they are in "asking for soup 'from the bottom'"

the intensification of inner life helped the prisoner to find refugee from his emptiness, desolation, and spiritual poverty of his existence => allowing him to escape into the past.

as the inner life of the prisoner tended to become more intense, he also experienced the beauty of art and nature as never before => escape mechanism (sunshine, sunset) "How beautiful the world could be"

We were grateful for the smallest of mercies.

A man counted only because he had a prison number. One literally became a number: dead or alive  - that was unimportant; the life a "number" was completely irrelevant
