## Review

To quote a review I found on Goodreads: "This is just mindblowing." 

For such a small book, the idea it presents, and the way it is presented is absolutely unmatched. For a book so small, the essences contains within the words and its idea is unmeasurable. 

And being someone who's practically entirely schooled and taught in the Western school of intellectual tradition, it takes the idea that has simply became facts for me, from desires, knowledge, trust, to wisdom, and turns it absolutely on its head. 

It has got to be one of the most perennially beguiling, elliptical things ever written. It is the one book that I'm sure that I'll reread on and on: each time learning and understanding something new from it. 

## Summary

Due to the nature that the 'book' is written and the fact that I don't believe myself to have understood the text nearly enough to begin summarizing it, I would like to instead presents a collection of quotes that especially struck me.

### The Opposing Nature of Nature

 When people see things as beautiful, ugliness is created. When people see things as good, evil is created.

- Under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness. All can know good as good only because there is evil.

- One gains by losing And loses by gaining.

- Truly good people are not aware of their goodness, And are therefore good. Foolish people try to be good, And are therefore not good.

- Truthful words are not beautiful. Beautiful words are not truthful. Good people do not argue. Those who argue are not good. Those who know are not learned. The learned do not know. The wise never try to hold on to things. The more you do for others, the more you have. The more you give to others, the greater your abundance.

### The Self

- Knowing others is wisdom; Knowing the self is enlightenment. Mastering others requires force; Mastering the self needs strength.

- Those who are attached to things will suffer greatly. Those who save will suffer heavy losses. Those who are contented are never disappointed. Those who know when to stop do not find themselves in trouble. They remain forever safe.

### Lessons on Living

- Accept disgrace willingly. Accept misfortune as the human condition.

- Because you do not compete, You will not have competition.

- A good soldier is not violent. A good fighter is not angry. A good winner is not vengeful. A good employer is humble.

- The stiff and unbending is the disciple of death. The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life. Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle. A tree that is unbending is easily broken. The hard and strong will fall. The soft and weak will overcome.


### Achieving Usefulness and Results

- Profit comes from what is there; Usefulness from what is not there.

- Achieve results, But never glory in them. Achieve results, But never boast. Achieve results, But never be proud. Achieve results, Because this is the natural way. Achieve results, But not through violence.

- Great accomplishment seems imperfect, Yet it does not outlive its usefulness. Great fullness seems empty, Yet it cannot be exhausted.

- Happiness is rooted in misery. Misery lurks beneath happiness.

### Wisdom

- Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know.

- The wise are sharp but not cutting, Pointed but not piercing, Straightforward but not unrestrained, Brilliant but not blinding.

- See simplicity in the complicated. Achieve greatness in small things.

- Knowing ignorance is strength. Ignoring knowledge is sickness.

- The wise work without recognition. They achieve what has to be done without dwelling on it. They do not try to show their knowledge.


### Desire

- There is no greater sin than craving, No greater curse than discontent, No greater misfortune than wanting something for ourselves. Therefore those who know that enough is enough will always have enough.

### Leadership

- When the country is ruled with a light hand, The people are simple. When the country is ruled harshly, The people are cunning.

- If you would guide the people, you must serve with humility. If you would lead them, you must follow behind.

- Those who would conquer must yield, And those who conquer do so through yielding.
