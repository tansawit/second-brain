# Books - Philosophy

### Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu ❋

*Read: October 2019* (✭✭✭✭✭) [(Book)](https://amzn.to/32qgbfd) [(Review & Notes)]({{<relref "/docs/books/philosophy/tao-te-ching">}})

> There is no greater sin than craving, No greater curse than discontent, No greater misfortune than wanting something for ourselves. Therefore those who know that enough is enough will always have enough.

It has got to be one of the most perennially beguiling, elliptical things ever written. It is the one book that I’m sure that I’ll reread on and on: each time learning and understanding something new from it. For such a small book, the idea it presents, and the way it is presented is absolutely unmatched. For a book so small, the essences contains within the words and its idea is unmeasurable. To quote a review I found on Goodreads: “This is just mindblowing.”
