# Topic Notes - Startups

## Playlist/Courses Notes

### [How to Start a Startup]({{<relref "/docs/topic/startups/start-a-startup">}})

Personally I consider it one of the de-facto resources on the topic. Series of video lectures by Y Combinator, originally given at Stanford University in Fall of 2014. The lecture topics covers the journey from ideation to late-stage advice.

### [Startup School (2019)]({{<relref "/docs/topic/startups/startup-school">}})

A 10-week online course offered by Y Combinator providing advice and mentoring on evaluating your startups, developing a product, financing, all the way to launching your MVP and developing a company culture.
