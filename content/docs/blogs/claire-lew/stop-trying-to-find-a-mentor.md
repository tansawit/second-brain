## Review

A very thought-provoking article. In a time where finding a 'mentor' seems to the standard advice given to people just starting out in leadership roles, this article not only tries to put the term 'leadership' into context but also suggests an alternative and potentially better way of finding the things most look to receive from their mythical 'mentors'.

## Notes

Finding a mentor won't save you. That magical, individual mentor doesn't exist. Yes there are people with terrific experience and expertise who are willing to share their knowledge and helpful pointers to you. But they're not _you_

Leadership is not a transferrable good, and true leadership is the thought that behavior that originates from th leader themselves, not borrowed, not taken. It's the things you say and do given your specific contexts, values, and constraint. And if you bet your entire survival on finding that mentor or people to give you advice, you're setting yourself up for failure.

The point of leadership is to carve a path for others to do their best work. But you can't do that if you're constantly trying to match that to path someone else created.

So, instead of looking for a mentor, look to your team. Ask each of them:

- What's the biggest gap between intention and action?
- Where am I letting you down right now?
- What do you see as my greatest potential?
- When's the last time I was useful to you?

Doing so, and doing so multiple times, will shine a brighter light on your deficiencies and proficiencies than ever before.
