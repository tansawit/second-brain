- Reply only to questions and/or positive comments to reduce anxiety and exhaustion
- Don't send things people don't want to get
- Don't send marketing emails to people who are already customers.
  - It is disrespectful to bombard people with "buy" campaigns when they already have
- Don't believe in sending only one email announcing a campaign or bargain
  - "value, value, value, value, value, soft sell, value, value, hard sell, repeat"
