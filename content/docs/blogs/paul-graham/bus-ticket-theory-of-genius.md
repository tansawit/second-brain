# The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius - Paul Graham

[(Original Article)](http://www.paulgraham.com/genius.html)

## Introduction

Ingredients to doing great work:

- Ability
- Determination
- Obsessive interest in the topic

Obsessive interest is both a proxy for ability and substitute for determination.

It is a mistake to think that early works were done to "lay the groundwork" for the later results. They were only doing it because they like it.

Recipe for genius in one sentence: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.

The disinterested obsession is the most important feature, as the paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising.

## Finding Something Promising

Similar to Carlyle's famous definition of genius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. But the bus ticket theory adds one important quality: its about having an infinite capacity for taking pains about something *that matters*.

You can never be sure what will matter, but there can be heuristics you can use to guess:

- It's more promising if you're creating rather than consuming
- It's more promising if it's something that's difficult for other people than for you
- It's more promising if it's the obsession of talented people

>When talented people become interested in random thing,s they're not truly random.

It may also be true that to do great work , you also have to waste a lot of time. In many areas, reward is proportionate to risk. And these returns change over time, dramatically.

What can we do?

- Hedge your bets, follow the obviously promising path instead of your private obsession (decrease reward)
- Let yourself be interested in a lot of different thing (might not get deeply into any of them.)

## Other potential benefits of the Bus Ticket Theory

It might explain why different people excel at different kinds of work. Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability.

It also explains why people are less likely to do great work after they have children. Your interest now has to compete with another, as well as external obstacles.

It also suggest a way to avoid 'slowing down when you're older'. You might slow down because you can no longer mess about with irresponsible side projects. The solution is then simple: remain irresponsible

Most excitingly, the theory suggests ways to encourage work. If the recipe for genius is simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope we have a lot of ability, and work as hard as we can. But if interest is a critical ingredient in genius, we may be able, by cultivating interest, to cultivate genius.
