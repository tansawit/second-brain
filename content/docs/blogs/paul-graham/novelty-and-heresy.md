# Novelty and Heresy

[(Original Article)](http://www.paulgraham.com/nov.html)

> If you discover something new, there's a significant chance you'll be accused of some form of heresy.

To discover new things, you need work on ideas that are good but non-obvious. One way for a common idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the shadow o of some mistaken assumption. You will then most likely get heat from people attached to that assumption.

"Every cherished mistaken assumption has the more preposterous the assumption. And The bigger the dead zone it creates."

Upside: look for heresies if you're looking for new ideas.

Looking at it this way, the dead zone becomes mines of new ideas.
