# Beating the Averages

## Choosing Technology for your Startups

When choosing technology, ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best. If you bet on the wrong technology, your competitors will crush you.

If you're building a software that only need to run on your server, you have the freedom of using any language you want. This, however, could be a double-edged sword: Now that you use any language , you *need to think* about which one to actually use


If you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here's a handy tip for evaluating competitors. Read their job listings. It can tell you which ones to worry about and which not to.

## Averages

If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. But average performance, for a startup, means you'll go out of business.

> In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing. But a startup can't do what all the other startups do

## The Programming Languages Power Continuum

Programming languages vary in power. The reason everyone doesn't use the most 'powerful' one is because programming languages are not merely technologies , but habits of mind as well.

If you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one.

Exceptions:

- Writing a program that needs to work closely with another written in a certain language => Use the same language
- Writing a program that does something very simple => Use a less abstract language, for performance as well
- Writing a short, throwaway program => Use language that has the best library functions for the task

However, two problems still arises even with these exceptions:

After a certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily. Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider just good enough.


Programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in. They're half technology and half religion.

### The Power Continuum Paradox

When someone is looking down the power continuum, they realize they're doing so.

But when someone is looking up in the other direction, they don't realize they're doing so.

A language is good enough for them, because they think in that language.

If we switch to a programmer up the power continuum, we find that they're looking down at the previous programmer.

Thus, by induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one. 

> You can't trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox: they're satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs.
