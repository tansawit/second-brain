# Productivity

Compound growth works not only in financial concepts, but careers as well.

## Summary

Pick the right thing to work on. Prioritize what you do in a way that generates momentum. Value your time. Don't chase productivity for its own sake. Know what helps you do your best work.

## Notes

### What you work on

> It doesn’t matter how fast you move if it’s in a worthless direction. 

Pick the right thing to work on. If you find yourself always agreeing with whomever you last spoke with, that's bad. Develop the confidence to stick with your conviction.

How to brainstorm/choose what to work on:

- Read books
- Hang out with interesting people
- Spend time in nature

Spend less time doing things you don't like (by delegating, avoiding etc.) as those things might make you less productive.

*Note: try to figure out who likes (and is good at) doing what, and delegate that way.*

Short-term burnout happens, but if it persists, maybe it’s time to do something you’re more interested in. 

It’s important to learn that you can learn anything you want, and that you can get better quickly.

Try to be around smart, productive, happy, and positive people that don’t belittle your ambitions.

You have to both pick the right problem and do the work. If you're to make something great, you need to work both smart and hard.

### Prioritization

>The right goal is to allocate your year optimally, not your day.


Sam Altman's three key pillars:

- Make sure to get the important shit do**

- Don't waste time on stupid shit**

- Make lots of lists**

Lists of what you want to accomplish each year, month, and day. Maybe don't bother with categorization or sizing.

Prioritize in a way that generates momentum. Be ruthless in saying to to stuff, do the non-critical things in the quickest way possible.

Having an open network is valuable.

(Maybe) have different times of day for different kind of works. Also, most people don't value their time enough.

**Don't chase productivity for its own sakes. It doesn’t matter what system you use or if you squeeze out every second if you’re working on the wrong thing.**

### Physical Factors

Different things work for different people.

Example

- Sleep and sleep aids
- Exercise
- Nutrition
- Room conditions
- Food/alcohol consumption

### Other stuff

Think about what's an optimal working space for you. Avoid situations and people that put you in a bad mood.

It might be good to overcommit a bit. Taking a bit too on can make you more efficient at everything, possibly helping to train to avoid distractions.

**Don't neglect your friends and family for the sake of productivity. Don't neglect doing things you love that clear your head either.**
