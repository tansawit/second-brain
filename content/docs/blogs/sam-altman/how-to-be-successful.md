# How To Be Successful

*13 Points for Achieving Outlier Results*

*[Original Article](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) by Sam Altman*

Usually people starts out wanting to make huge amounts of money but end up later wanting to create something important instead.

While these are easier after having already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or efforts), it applies to anyone.

## Compound Yourself

>Trust the exponential, be patient, and be pleasantly surprised.


Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation.

With technology, businesses will achieve true network effect and extreme scalability, and it's worth the time and effort to find and create them.

In your personal life, it's important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect, whereas most are linear.

Can achieve this leverage through

- capital
- technology
- networks effects
- people management

**Tactics**:

Add another zero to your personal success metric. Your next project should be one that makes the rest of your career look like a footnote.

Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes.

The biggest competitive advantage in business is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together.

## Have almost too much self-belief

If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created.

This must be balanced with self-awareness. **Truthseeking is hard and painful, but it's what separates self-belief from self-delusion**

## Learn to think independently

“I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way.

One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more you do this, the more you believe in it.

## Get good at "sales"

Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.

The best way to get good at sales is to genuinely believe in the item you're trying to sell. 

Show up in person whenever it's important

## Make it easy to take risks

Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward.

Look for small bets where you lose 1x if you're wrong but make 100x if it works. Make bigger bets in that direction.

Don't save up for too long. It's easy and our nature to prioritize short-term rewards over long-term fulfillment.

## Focus

Focus is a force multiplier on work.

It's more important to work on the right thing than to work many hours.

## Work hard

Extreme people get extreme results.

You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both.

Do it early, at the beginning of your career. The earlier you do it, the longer the benefits have to compound.

Figure out how to work hard without burning out. Find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot time with.


## Be bold

Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too. 

If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you.

## Be willful

> A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try

Ask for what you want. Those who persevere go on to succeed.

Be optimistic.

## Be hard to compete with

> If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.

Build up leverage. Build a strong personal brand. Get good at the intersection of multiple different fields. Figure out your own strategies

It is a mistake to do what most people they hang out with do.

## Build a network

Develop a network of talented people to work with. 

Help people as much as you can. Build a reputation of taking care of people who work with you. 

Learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in these roles. 

Get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Look for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.

>You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.

**Defining yourself**

Define yourself by your strength, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge the weaknesses and figure out how to overcome it, but don't let them stop you from doing what you want to do. 

Finally, spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.

## You get rich by owning things

In most cases, you don't get rich by having a high salaries, you get there by owning things that rapidly increase in value (e.g. businesses, properties, resources).

The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale

## Be internally driven

Don't do what you do to impress people. Two important reasons:

*You will work on a consensus idea and on consensus career track*

This will prevent you from doing truly interesting work, or someone else would have done it anyway

*You will get risk calculations wrong*

Too focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games

**Being internally driven**

Do what you do to impress yourself and because you're compelled to make something happen in the world

This is the only force, after gaining money and status, that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance.

This is why a person's motivation is important. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it.
