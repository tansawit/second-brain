# US Digital Currency

*[Original Article](https://blog.samaltman.com/us-digital-currency) by Sam Altman*

Cryptocurrency is here to stay in some form. The government could have to stopped previously, but that's now in the past.

The dominant cryptocurrency might not have been created yet (similar to the case of search engines and social networks).

Still the problem with the current systems in terms of pseudo-anonymity, ability to function as an actual currency, and taxability.

The US government might not be able to stop cryptocurrency, but it can create the winner and fix the challenges that governments currently face with it.

Possible usages:

- Certain transactions can only happen with wallets with known owners
- Build a tax system into the protocol

Challenges:

- Balancing letting the network have self-control and the government's degree of input

The current practice is for government and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to ignore each other. But might there exists a middle grown where each party gets a lot of what they want.
